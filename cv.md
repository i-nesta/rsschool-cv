## About me

For over 10 years I have been working as a manager in merchandising. Implemented agency-based
contracts and manufacturing companies. I've always wondered how development works.
And now I decided that it was time to learn this. I am purposeful, motivated to learn new things.
My goal is to reach the junior developer level in the next year. I strive for a high level of knowledge.
